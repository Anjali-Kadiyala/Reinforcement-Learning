# Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)

DDPG is an RL algorithm used for solving problems with continuous action spaces. It is an extension of the traditional Q-learning algorithm and is a model-free, off-policy actor-critic algorithm.

DDPG uses two neural networks, one called the actor and the other called the critic, to approximate the optimal policy and value function, respectively. The actor network learns to select actions that maximize the expected reward based on the current state, while the critic network learns to estimate the value function of the state-action pair.

DDPG uses a deterministic policy, which means that given a state, the actor network outputs a specific action, rather than a probability distribution over actions. This allows the agent to easily select actions in continuous action spaces, which is often difficult with traditional stochastic policies.

During training, the actor and critic networks are updated using a combination of temporal difference learning and backpropagation, which updates the weights of the networks to better approximate the optimal policy and value function. DDPG also uses a replay buffer to store past experiences. 

The replay buffer is used to store a collection of past experiences of the agent in the environment. The replay buffer is an important component of DDPG, as it allows the agent to learn from a diverse set of experiences, rather than only learning from the most recent experience. Replay buffer stores tuples of (state, action, reward, next state, done), which represent the agent's experience at a specific time step. When the buffer is full, the oldest experiences are removed to make space for new experiences. During training, the DDPG algorithm randomly samples a batch of experiences from the replay buffer and uses them to update the actor and critic networks. This is known as experience replay, and it helps to decorrelate the experiences and reduce the variance of the updates, which can improve the stability and efficiency of the learning process.
